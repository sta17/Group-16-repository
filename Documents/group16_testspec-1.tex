\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
This document describes the test specifications for the project, which will be used when the first compiled version of the software is ready.

\subsection{Scope}
This document gives a detailed description of all test procedures, with instructions and pass criteria. This document should be read by all team members involved in coding.

\subsection{Objectives}
Coders are able to perform the tests performed.

\section{Test Procedures}
\subsection{Preface}
These tests are derived from the requirement specification \cite{reqspec} for this project. Each test has a reference to the specific requirement being tested and a test reference. The test reference indicate which part of system is being tested, with 'AND' meaning Android application and 'WEB' meaning the webpage.
